# IBGenerate
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBDecodable/IBGenerate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBDecodable/IBGenerate)
[![Swift 5.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.0-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

A tool to generate a code from your  `.storyboard` files to reduce the usage of Strings as identifiers for Segues or Storyboards.

It heavily inspired from [natalie](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie) by Marcin KrzyÅ¼anowski
(I (Eric Marchand) do some work on it, `macOS` using objects for decoding XML, etc...)

The main difference is that this project only generate the dynamic part of the code, the code generate from your storyboards.
The common code is in [IBStoryboard](https://github.com/IBDecodable/IBStoryboard) package and could be imported using SwiftPM.

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
...
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/IBDecodable/IBStoryboard.git", .revision("HEAD"))
...

```

:warning: ibgenerate work only for `iOS` for the moment.

## What the command generate exactly?

### Storyboards list

 A `Storyboards` struct with convenient functions to instanciate your view controllers.
 
```swift
struct Storyboards {
  struct Main {...}
  struct Second {...}
```

Instantiate initial view controller for storyboard

```swift
let vc = Storyboards.Main.instantiateInitialViewController()
```

### Enumeration for segues

```swift
extension MyViewController {

  enum Segue: String, CustomStringConvertible, SegueProtocol {
    case segueToFirst
    case segueToSecond

```

Enum that you can use with `IBStoryboard` function

```swift
self.performSegue(self.performSegue(MainViewController.Segue.segueToFirst, sender:nil), sender:nil)
```

### Enumeration for named colors

Storyboard could use named colors, and sometimes you need it also in your code and do not want to use the string.
So an enum is generated.

This also could be generated by reading assets.

## Install ibgenerate

### Using sources

```
git clone https://github.com/IBDecodable/IBGenerate.git
cd IBGenerate
make install
```

### Using Homebrew (swiftbrew)

If not already installed yet, install [Swiftbrew](https://github.com/swiftbrew/Swiftbrew) with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_fr)

```
brew install swiftbrew/tap/swiftbrew
```

then type 
```
swift brew install IBDecodable/IBGenerate
```

## Usage

You can see all description by `ibgenerate help`

```
$ ibgenerate help
Available commands:

   help      Display general or command-specific help
   generate  Generate code (default command)
   version   Display the current version of ibgenerate
```

### Generate command

In your working directory or by passing the `path` option launch the command to get see the generated code.

```
$ ibgenerate
//
// Autogenerated by ibgenerate - Storyboard Generator
//
import UIKit
import IBStoryboard

// MARK: - Storyboards
struct Storyboards {
```

You can redirect the ouput to a `Storyboards.swift` file, like done in xcode integration step.

### Xcode integration

Add a `Run Script Phase` to integrate IBGenerate with Xcode to generate the `Storyboards.swift`

```sh
if which ibgenerate >/dev/null; then
  echo "ibgenerate: Determining if generated Swift file is up-to-date."

  BASE_PATH="$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME"
  OUTPUT_PATH="$BASE_PATH/Storyboards.swift"

  if [ ! -e "$OUTPUT_PATH" ] || [ -n "$(find "$BASE_PATH" -type f -name "*.storyboard" -newer "$OUTPUT_PATH" -print -quit)" ]; then
    echo "ibgenerate: Generated Swift is out-of-date; re-generating..."

  /usr/bin/chflags nouchg "$OUTPUT_PATH"
  ibgenerate > "$OUTPUT_PATH"
  /usr/bin/chflags uchg "$OUTPUT_PATH"

  echo "ibgenerate: Done."
  else
    echo "ibgenerate: Generated Swift is up-to-date; skipping re-generation."
  fi
else
  echo "warning: IBGenerate not installed, download from https://github.com/IBDecodable/IBGenerate"
fi
```

## Requirements

IBGenerate requires Swift5.0 runtime. Please satisfy at least one of following requirements.

 - macOS 10.14.4 or later
 - Install `Swift 5 Runtime Support for Command Line Tools` from [More Downloads for Apple Developers](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)
 
## Configuration

You can configure IBGenerate by adding a `.ibgenerate.yml` file from project root directory.
